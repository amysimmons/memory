About

I started building Memory on an eight-hour flight from Sydney to Hong Kong. I was about to embark on a week-long holiday with two girlfriends - so why not build a game about memories!

I use the Instagram and Giphy APIs as sources for the cards. I use a Node Express server on the back end.

I took the photo covering the front of the cards in Soho, Central Hong Kong.
